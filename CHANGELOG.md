## [Unreleased]

### Added

- ✨ Add `mqt-scpd plan`, which runs the planning steps into a run directory:
  `--stop-after` and `[run] stop_after` end a run after a step, `--stage` runs
  one step again on the copies the run carries, and `-v`, `-vv` and `-vvv` show
  the steps, the items and the solver log. A run prints one block per stage with
  a live progress line on a terminal, in the format of
  `docs/terminal_output.md`. Add `list-algorithms`, and `plot` and `render` with
  `--stage` and `--run-dir` for the planning stages ([#139])
  ([**@FeldmeierMichael**])
- ✨ Add the planning stages: the Capacity stage partitions the free space at
  its bottlenecks and budgets the wires of every capacity chain, the Global
  stage solves the inner circuit as a mixed-integer program on Hanan lattices,
  the Assignment stage assigns the ring ports to launchers and feedline chains
  with an integer program, and the Corridor stage routes every connection
  through the partitions over border slots. They write the artifacts
  `01-capacity.fb` to `04-corridor.fb` ([#139]) ([**@FeldmeierMichael**])
- ✨ Add `MQT::ScpdMilp`: a linear model, the HiGHS backend with a progress and
  log observer, MPS output, and the choice of the backend through
  `[stages.solver] backend` or `SCPD_SOLVER`; Gurobi is used through `gurobipy`
  when it is installed and licensed ([#139]) ([**@FeldmeierMichael**])
- ✨ Add bridge pairs and components to the configuration: the `bridge_pair` and
  `component` patterns, the `[[ports.bridge_pairs]]` rules, the stage sections
  and `[run]` ([#139]) ([**@FeldmeierMichael**])
- ✨ Add the configurations of the eight benchmark chips in `benchmarks/`, and
  the `--chip` option of `doctor`, `plot`, `render` and `plan` ([#139])
  ([**@FeldmeierMichael**])
- ✨ Add `MQT::ScpdRouting`: a curvature-constrained A* over eight-way Dubins
  move primitives, with a distance-field heuristic, a bucket queue whose memory
  is that of its largest search, one shared read-only obstacle mask and
  per-thread scratch, an orthogonal search for feedline crossings, the path
  geometry decoder, turns with exact grid endpoints and tangents at the minimum
  bend radius, the self-intersection check and the coupler dogleg with
  complete-candidate validation. Crossing-mask rebuilds preserve the previous
  state on allocation failure ([#134]) ([**@FeldmeierMichael**],
  [**@marcelwa**])
- ✨ Add `MQT::ScpdGrid`: grid metrics and the rule-to-cell conversion
  `cellsFor`, bit grids, obstacle rasterization with the keepout, the exact
  distance transform and the watershed, and add the grid coordinate types
  `DCoord` and `RCoord` to the geometry schema ([#134])
  ([**@FeldmeierMichael**])
- 📝 Document how to run MQT SCPD on the benchmark chips of
  [planar-superconducting-pd](https://github.com/cda-tum/planar-superconducting-pd),
  and check every chip against it in CI ([#111]) ([**@marcelwa**])
- ✨ Add the `mqt-scpd` command line with `doctor`, `plot`, `render` and
  `inspect`: the `config.toml` and chip loaders, the port-role classification,
  the layout SVG, the KLayout adapter and the JSON view of the artifacts, which
  the core renders from the schema's own type tables ([#111])
  ([**@FeldmeierMichael**])
- 👷 Fail CI when the committed schema-generated code is stale ([#98])
  ([**@FeldmeierMichael**])
- ✨ Add semantic validation of the data model in the core and a checked
  artifact read and write layer in C++ and Python ([#98])
  ([**@FeldmeierMichael**])
- ✨ Add the FlatBuffers schemas of the data model, the committed C++ and Python
  code generated from them, and the `nox -s schemas` session ([#98])
  ([**@FeldmeierMichael**])
- 🏗️ Split the core into the eight per-module CMake targets of the architecture
  ([#98]) ([**@FeldmeierMichael**])
- 🐍 Start building CPython 3.15 wheels ([#67]) ([**@denialhaag**])
- ✨ Set up the repository ([#1]) ([**@denialhaag**])

### Changed

- 🎨 Start the result line of `plot`, `render` and `inspect` with `✓` and an
  error with `✗`, and show the `bridge_pair` pattern and the reachable solvers
  in `doctor` ([#139]) ([**@FeldmeierMichael**])
- 🔧 Build the module libraries, the tests and the Python bindings with
  floating-point contraction off (`-ffp-contract=off`, and
  `/clang:-ffp-contract=off` for clang-cl), also inside a parent project that
  defines `MQT::ProjectOptions`, so that a sum of products rounds the same on
  every compiler and target; MSVC does not contract since Visual Studio 2022,
  and the configuration warns for an older MSVC ([#134])
  ([**@FeldmeierMichael**])
- ♻️ Make `[ports.sequences]` required and drop the `detection` and
  `start_component` keys of the configuration schema; the outer port ring is
  configuration only ([#111]) ([**@FeldmeierMichael**])
- 💥 Drop support for x86 macOS and stop publishing the respective wheels
  ([#89]) ([**@denialhaag**])
- ⬆️ Raise the macOS deployment target to 13.3 to enable `std::format` in libc++
  ([#89]) ([**@denialhaag**])
- 💥 Require Python 3.11 or newer ([#89]) ([**@denialhaag**])
- ⬆️ Update `nanobind` to version 3.0.1 ([#83]) ([**@denialhaag**])
